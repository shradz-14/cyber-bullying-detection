Cyberbullying Detection Using Explainable AI and Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI/ML-based cyberbullying detection system that analyzes user-generated text and classifies it as cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying. It further categorizes bullying into Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Religion, and Other types while ensuring transparency through Explainable AI.

🎯 Objectives

1. Automatically detect cyberbullying in online comments
2. Classify bullying into multiple categories
3. Analyze sentiment and emotion associated with the text
4. Explain model predictions using Explainable AI techniques

🧠 Technologies Used
-Python
-Machine Learning (Text Classification)
-TF-IDF Vectorization
-Logistic Regression / SVM
-Explainable AI (LIME)
-Sentiment & Emotion Analysis

Google Colab
